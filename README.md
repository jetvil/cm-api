# @jetvil/cm-api

📚 Content management API for integrating with NodeJS(backend) and MongoDB

# Features

- 🚀 **Easy to use**: Easy to install in your project.
- ✅ **ES6+ && TS**: TypeScript and ES6+ support(JS).
- 📦 **No dependencies**: You don't depend on anything else.
- 💵 **Free**: It's free and always will be, the beauty of open source.

Take in mind that this solution is for when you want to control your own backend and frontend, but do not want to have struggle to create a cms with all the routes and schemas and database handlers that come with it.

When you are looking for a full cms solution, we recommend strapi or changing languages and taking wagtail for python.
