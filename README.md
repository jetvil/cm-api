# cms
ðŸ“š Content management API for integrating with NodeJS(backend) and MongoDB

Take in mind that this solution is for when you want to control your own backend and frontend, but do not want to have struggle to create a CMS with all the routes and schemas and database handlers that come with it.

When you are looking for a full CMS solution, we recommend strapi or changing languages and taking wagtail for python.
