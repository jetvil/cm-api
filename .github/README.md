📚 Content management API for integrating with NodeJS Express(backend) and Prisma(ORM)

# Features

- 🚀 **Easy to use**: Easy to install in your project.
- ✅ **ES6+ && TS**: TypeScript and ES6+ support(JS).
- 📦 **Required dependencies**: You don't need what you won't use: express and prisma.
- 💵 **Free**: It's free and always will be, the beauty of open source.

Take in mind that this solution is for when you want to control your own backend and frontend, but do not want to have struggle to create a cms with all the routes and schemas and database handlers that come with it.

When you are looking for a full cms solution, we recommend strapi or changing languages and taking wagtail for python.
